Architecture

The app uses Expo + React Native with the following key components:

Screens / Pages

PlacesList.jsx: Displays searchable list of places

Favorites.jsx: Displays userâ€™s favorite places stored in Redux

State Management

Redux is used for storing favorites. This allows global access to favorite places from any screen.

Services

placesApi.js: Handles API requests to Google Places with dynamic search queries.

Requests are POST requests with textQuery dynamically populated.

Theming

themeContext.js: Provides light/dark theme state to components.

Navigation

Expo Router handles navigation between pages (PlacesList, Favorites, PlaceDetails).

Navigation actions use router.push() with dynamic parameters.

Design Decisions

Expo + React Native:
Provides cross-platform support and faster development compared to native projects.

Redux for Favorites:
Simple and scalable state management. Favorites can be accessed from any screen without prop drilling.

Dynamic Search:
Search bar lets users enter any query and fetch live results from Google Places.

API Integration:
Google Places API provides rich information about locations. Using textQuery allows flexibility and accurate search results.

Theming:
Light/dark theme support improves accessibility and user experience.
